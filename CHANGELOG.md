## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added

#### Core Features
- âœ¨ **BreakGLB Component** - Main React component for 3D model explosion visualization
- ðŸŽ® **Interactive Controls** - Full mouse and touch support for desktop and mobile
- ðŸ’¥ **Physics-Based Animation** - Realistic part separation with collision detection
- ðŸŽ¯ **Part Selection** - Click to focus on individual parts with smooth camera animation
- ðŸŽ¨ **Material Customization** - Configure metalness, roughness, wireframe, and more
- ðŸ’¡ **Dynamic Lighting** - Adjustable light position with 3-finger touch or right-click drag

#### Animation System
- **Animation Presets** - Pre-configured animation modes: gentle, normal, energetic, dramatic
- **Custom Easing** - Support for linear, easeIn, easeOut, easeInOut, and bounce easing
- **Stagger Effect** - Configurable delay between part explosions

- **Environment Presets** - 10 lighting environments (studio, sunset, warehouse, etc.)
- **Camera Controls** - Configurable rotation, zoom, pan with limits
- **Debug Helpers** - Optional grid and axes helpers
- **Material Override** - Per-model material customization
- **Color Theming** - Highlight and selection color customization

#### UI Components
- **Upload Zone** - Drag-and-drop file upload with validation
- **Loading Component** - Animated loading indicator with progress bar
- **Error Display** - User-friendly error messages with retry option
- **Control Panel** - Minimalist control buttons for explode/upload

#### Accessibility
